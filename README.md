# Advanced React and GraphQL
This is my work for Wes Bos's [Advanced React + GraphQL](https://advancedreact.com/) course.

My final version of the project can be seen [here](https://sickfits-next-react-prod.herokuapp.com/). It may take a while to load the first time because now.sh sleeps free-tier deployments that haven't received a request recently.
