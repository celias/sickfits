# Advanced React and GraphQL
This is my work for Wes Bos's [Advanced React + GraphQL](https://advancedreact.com/) course.

My final version of the project can be seen [here](https://sickfits-next-react-prod.herokuapp.com/). It may take a while to load the first time because now.sh sleeps free-tier deployments that haven't received a request recently.

# Sick Fits
Sick Fits is a full stack online clothing store complete with real credit checkout. Users can search, sell, add to cart and checkout their favorite items. The application has five main models — __Users, Items, Orders, CartItems, and OrderItems__ — all of which are relational and showcase the power of relational GraphQL Queries.
